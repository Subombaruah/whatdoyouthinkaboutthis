        If a you makes a mistake, do we punish your parents? When a stranger make mistake do we punish your parents .Then why should entire nations be blamed for the actions of a few? Govt take dicision, terrorist take life, but in the end- its always the innocent who bleed. This article is a voice not for one country, but for peace, for logic, for humanity.
      </p>

      <h2>Injustice in the Name of Justice</h2>
      <p>
        The recent Sindur mission has sparked debates across borders. Though meant as retaliation against terrorism, it raises one haunting question—why are innocent lives always caught in the crossfire of politics and power?
      </p>

      <h2>Collateral Damage or Collective Guilt?</h2>
      <p>
        Should Pakistani civilians suffer because of what a few extremists did? Is it right to bomb, threaten, or isolate a population that had no say in the violence? In seeking justice, are we creating more pain?
      </p>

      <h2>The Way Forward</h2>
      <p>
        True power lies in wisdom, not revenge. It’s time leaders rise above war cries and choose compassion. A nation’s strength should be measured by how it protects the innocent, not how many it can destroy.
      </p>

      <p style="margin-top: 40px; font-style: italic; color: #ffcccc;">
        When bombs fall, it's the poor who bleed. Let’s not make common people pawns of political games.
