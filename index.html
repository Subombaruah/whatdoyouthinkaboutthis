  <h1 style="color: red; font-size: 3em; text-align: center;">Should Innocent People Suffer?</h1>
  <p style="font-size: 1.2em;">In a world filled with political tension and violence, one question echoes louder than ever — should innocent people suffer for the sins of others?</p>

  <h2 style="color: white;">The Case of Pakistan and India</h2>
  <p>When terrorism strikes, the world demands justice. But too often, that justice ends up punishing the everyday citizens — the shopkeepers, the students, the workers — who had nothing to do with it.</p>

  <p>As tensions rise between India and Pakistan, it's important to remember that the people are not the politics. A terrorist act may come from a group, but entire populations are blamed. This is wrong. This is dangerous.</p>

  <h2 style="color: white;">Is This True Justice?</h2>
  <p>If a stranger commits a crime in your city, would you want your family punished for it? Then why do we accept it when countries do the same?</p>

  <h2 style="color: white;">A Call for Humanity</h2>
  <p>This article isn't about taking sides. It's about taking a stand — for common people. For peace. For a world where the innocent aren't crushed in the fight between powers.</p>

  <blockquote style="background-color: #222; border-left: 5px solid red; padding: 10px; font-style: italic; margin: 30px 0;">
    “Justice is not served by punishing the voiceless.”
  </blockquote>

  <p>Think about it. Speak up. Share this. Let’s not stay silent when the price of war is paid by those who never signed up for it.</p>
